# Clear and re-populate the cuny_departments table.
# This table includes {institution, division, department} tuples.
#
# The problem is that there is no table in CUNYfirst that pairs departments with divisions. Rather,
# each course in the course catalog has both acad_org (department) and acad_grp (division) fields,
# albeit with the same department being paired with different divisions for different courses.
#
# To determine the division each department belongs to, count how many times the department is
# paired with a division in the course catalog, and pick the division that has the largest number of
# pairings when there is more than one.
#
# Generates a log file of anomalies found.
